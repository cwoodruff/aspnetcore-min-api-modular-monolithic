# 0010. Administration summarizes customer purchases from Orders' InvoiceFinalized events

- Status: Accepted
- Date: 2026-10-01
- Phase: 3 (see `docs/upgrade-plan.md`)

## Context

Administration manages customers and wants each customer's purchase totals.
Invoices are Orders' data and reference customers by id only (ADR-0004).

## Decision

- Administration keeps `administration.CustomerPurchaseSummary`
  (CustomerId, TotalSpent, InvoiceCount, LastPurchaseAt). Its
  `InvoiceFinalized` handler adds the invoice total, increments the count
  and keeps the latest invoice date. Events without a customer id are
  ignored.
- `GET /api/admin/customers/{id}/purchases` (role.admin,
  administration.read, tenant.scoped) returns it, or zeros for a customer
  with no counted purchases, and 404 for an unknown customer. It is not
  cached.

## Consistency

Outbox, eventual, as in ADR-0009.

What a client or UI must not promise:

- That a just-finalized invoice is already in the summary.
- That `TotalSpent` or `InvoiceCount` cover the customer's whole history.
  Only invoices finalized since phase 3 are counted; seeded invoices are
  not, and there is no backfill.
- That the summary matches `GET /api/orders/invoices/customer/{id}` at any
  given moment. Orders is the source of truth for invoices; the summary is a
  projection that catches up.

## Consequences

- Administration can show purchase totals without reading Orders.
- A failure in this handler is retried and eventually dead-lettered without
  holding back Catalog's track sales.
- Totals are not recalculated if an invoice's lines change after
  finalization; nothing allows that today.

## How to reverse

Drop the summary table and handler; purchase totals would then come from a
read contract on Orders.
